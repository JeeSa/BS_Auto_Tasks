# BS_Auto_Tasks
In this repository I'm going to push all the tasks from BS-23 Automation test questionnaire.

I pushed the solution of task 1 & 2 and for the task 3, I'm adding the Query for the problem here
The Query for the task 3 will be:

SELECT NAME 
FROM STUDENTS 
WHERE Marks > X 
ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME, 3), ID ASC;

Here I didn't mention the value of the marks because in the question, the value of the marks was not mentioned.
